## Project Structure & Key Decisions

This project follows a modular structure, separating concerns into components, services, models, and assets. The main UI logic resides in the `SidemenuComponent`, with data handled via a service pattern for simplicity and maintainability. Angular Material is used for rapid UI development and consistent design.

**Key Decisions:**
- **Standalone Components:** Leveraged Angular’s standalone component architecture for easier scaling and reduced boilerplate.
- **Service-based State Management:** Used a service pattern for state, which is sufficient for a small app. This keeps business logic out of components and makes testing easier.
- **Material Design & Custom Tokens:** Adopted Angular Material and custom design tokens for theming and accessibility.
- **Mock Data:** Used local JSON for initial data, allowing quick iteration without backend dependencies.

## Scaling Strategy

If this app were to grow, I would:

- **Introduce NgRx for State Management:**  
  As the app’s complexity increases (multiple views, user settings, notifications, etc.), NgRx would help manage global state, side effects, and data consistency.  
  - **Store Structure Example:**
    ```typescript
    interface AppState {
      tasks: TaskState;
      users: UserState;
      ui: UiState;
    }

    interface TaskState {
      entities: { [id: string]: Task };
      loading: boolean;
      error: string | null;
      selectedTaskId: string | null;
    }

    interface UserState {
      entities: { [id: string]: User };
      loading: boolean;
      error: string | null;
    }

    interface UiState {
      theme: 'light' | 'dark';
      sidenavOpen: boolean;
    }
    ```
  - **Benefits:**  
    - Centralized state for easier debugging and scaling
    - Predictable data flow with actions and reducers
    - Built-in support for effects (async operations) and selectors (derived state)

- **API Integration:**  
  Replace mock data with real API endpoints, using NgRx Effects for data fetching and error handling.

- **Feature Modules:**  
  Split the app into feature modules (e.g., Tasks, Users, Settings) for better maintainability and lazy loading.

- **Advanced UI:**  
  Add skeleton loaders, virtual scrolling, and more responsive layouts for performance and UX.

- **Testing & CI:**  
  Expand unit and integration tests, and set up continuous integration for quality assurance.

## Summary

The current structure is optimized for rapid prototyping and clarity. With more time and requirements, I’d move to NgRx for robust state management, modularize features, and integrate real APIs to support a scalable, maintainable enterprise-
